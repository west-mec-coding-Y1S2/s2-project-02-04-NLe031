                    Towers and Temples is the winner of the 2017 Palmer Medal for Best New Simulation Board Game. Players adopt role cards of
                    characters from ancient Greece and Rome in an attempt to manage the administration of a city. Each role
                    provides a different ability and strategy. However, one role card belongs to a deadly assassin and players
                    must be constantly aware of betrayal and double-cross. This card game provides a ton of enjoyment and
                    can handle up to eight players and expansion packs available for larger parties.</p>

                <p> This is a nicely balanced game, where each player must carefully choose his or her roles and the strategies
                    can quickly change with the turn of a card. However the level of randomness is just right and cunning
                    and resourcefulness can overcome bad luck (if given time.) I do not recommend this game unless there
                    are at least 4 players; less than that reduces the intrigue and some of the game appeal.
